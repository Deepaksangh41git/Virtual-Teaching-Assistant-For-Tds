# ðŸŽ“ Virtual Teaching Assistant for TDS 

This project is a **Virtual Teaching Assistant API** built to help answer student questions for the **Tools in Data Science (TDS)** course 
The assistant can automatically answer student queries using:  
- ðŸ“˜ **Course content** (Jan 2025 batch, as of 15 Apr 2025)  
- ðŸ’¬ **TDS Discourse posts** (1 Jan 2025 â€“ 14 Apr 2025)  

By scraping and processing these sources, the API provides reliable, context-aware answers so that teaching assistants donâ€™t have to respond to the same questions repeatedly.
